### [Allied Garage Door](https://allieddoor.com/).
In **1982**, my grandpa _Larry Paris_ had began to put a company in motion that is now providing commercial and residential garage door services to the Chicaagoland area 40 years later. We have stayed a family owned, private company since our creation. My mom and uncle had started working for my gramdpa as young adult, and when I turned 18, I followed in the family footsteps and took on a role as a full time employee in our current warehouse. From there I recieved proffesional training and went on to be a residential techician. I install 8 to 12 garage doors in a full work week and have overseen a 60 garage door project at an apartment complex in Aurora, IL.

>After my time at Mizzou I plan to move back home with the knowledge i'll have obtained to further improve our productivity and find ways to incoorperate new technology into the company.

### Career Path
I am currently enrolled in the engineering school and working towards a BS in informational technology and am hoping to persue a minor in finance or management.

After spending a handful of semesters as a part time student due to COVID-19, I am once again fully enrolled in courses. With the additional summer classes that I will be taking, I expect to graduate spring of 2023.

#### Personal
Travel is a hobby I try tp participate most in. While I have not done any major travel since COVID-19, I grequent back home to Illinios and spend some weekends in St. Louis.

I grew up skate boarding and snowboarding and I have gotten the oppertunity to surf. I skate the most just because I do not live in an environment that allows oppertunity for the other two activities. I would have to say my favorite out of the three is surfing tho.
